    \caption{Hierarchy of parameters. Parameters are arranged vertically from bottom to top based on their comparative scaling (the relation being $\lp$). Treewidth is positioned at the bottom, indicating one of the smallest parameters, while $n$ represents the number of vertices in the graph at the top. A line between two parameters signifies comparability.}
