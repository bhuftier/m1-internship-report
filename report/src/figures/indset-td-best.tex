    \caption{Finding the largest independent set $\I$ of a clause gadget $C_j$. On the left, the case where no $x_j^A$ are allowed in $\I$. The cliques are shown in blue. On the right, the case where $x_j^A$ can be in $\I$. The cliques are shown in red. An example of an independent set of size $\alpha_j$ is shown in gray, with the \textit{good} triangles highlighted in green.}
