    \caption{Reduction from SAT to \prob{IndependentSet}: on the left, a group gadget for $p = 6$, for readability, only one pair $(A, A')$ has been depicted, but there are $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ such pair $(A, A')$. The assignment associate to $A$ satisfies clauses $c_1$ and $c_3$. On the right, a clause gadget with 7 assignments validating $c_j$, in blue we have shown the depth of the vertices during the construction of the gadget. One best independent set has been shown in red for both gadgets.}
