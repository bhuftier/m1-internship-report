    \caption{How to transform a treedepth decomposition into a pathwidth decomposition. (a) A graph $G$. (b) A treedepth decomposition of $G$. (c) Bags of a path decomposition of $G$ which follow the treedepth decomposition. (d) The path decomposition of these bags. We can see that the depth of the treedepth decomposition is the same as the width of the path decomposition.}
